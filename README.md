## Introduction

### Spambase Dataset
The "spam" concept is diverse: advertisements for products/web sites, make money fast schemes, chain letters, pornography...
	
Our collection of spam e-mails came from our postmaster and individuals who had filed spam.  Our collection of non-spam e-mails came from filed work and personal e-mails, and hence the word 'george' and the area code '650' are indicators of non-spam.  These are useful when constructing a personalized spam filter.  One would either have to blind such non-spam indicators or get a very wide collection of non-spam to generate a general purpose spam filter.
